# About 
After 8 years as a Marine, I decided to pack my green duffle bag and throw it at technologies' door(gently ofcourse ðŸ˜„).
Focused and excited Software Developer by day, determined and enthusiatic student at night. I have backend development
experience with Adobe Experience Manager. On my down time I enjoy spending time with family and nature, one of my favorite
destinations is Lake Cushman. Going forward, my goal is to begin contributing to as many open source projects as I can - 
focused on web based projects then branch out from there!
