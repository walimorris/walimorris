# About 
After 8 years as a Marine, I decided to pack my green duffle bag and throw it at technologies door(gently ofcourse ðŸ˜„).
Focused and excited Software Developer by day, determined and enthusiatic student at night. I have backend development
experience with Adobe Experience Manager and Apache Sling framework. On my down time I enjoy spending time with family
and nature, one of my favorite destinations being Lake Cushman. Going forward, my goal is to begin contributing to as 
many open source projects as I can - focusing on web based applications using nodejs, expressjs, and spring.
